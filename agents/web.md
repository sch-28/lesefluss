# RSVP Website

TanStack Start (React SSR) project website. Open-source project site — showcases the app and device, lets people download/build freely, and optionally create an account for cloud sync.

> **THE WEBSITE HAS NOT DEPLOYED YET — STILL IN DEV**

For project overview see `../AGENTS.md`.

## Tech Stack

- **TanStack Start** (React SSR) + TanStack Router (file-based)
- **Drizzle ORM** + PostgreSQL (`drizzle-orm/node-postgres`)
- **Better Auth** v1.6.x — email+password, self-hosted, Drizzle adapter, `tanstackStartCookies` plugin
- **Deployment**: Docker on VPS (Dockerfile scaffolded)

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev      # dev server
pnpm build
```

## Routes

| Route | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `/` | ✅ | Hero → App section → Features → Device section → Open source CTA |
| `/app/*` | ✅ | Embedded capacitor web build (SPA catch-all, see Web App Embed below) |
| `/download` | ✅ | Download buttons, feature grid, requirements |
| `/device` | ✅ | Hardware page: AMOLED vs ST7789 cards, parts list, build guide CTA |
| `/docs` | ✅ | Single-page docs with sidebar (Getting Started, Importing Books, ESP32 Build Guide, Connecting Device, Troubleshooting) |
| `/login` | ✅ | Sign-in / sign-up with Better Auth email+password |
| `/diy` | ✅ | Redirects to `/device` |
| `/order` | ✅ | Redirects to `/device` |
| `/api/sync` | ✅ | GET (pull) + POST (push) — full-snapshot sync, requireAuth + CORS middleware |
| `/account` | ❌ | Not started — auth-gated; connected devices, sync status, danger zone |

## routeTree.gen.ts

`src/routeTree.gen.ts` is **auto-generated** by the TanStack Router vite plugin. Never edit it manually — it is overwritten on every dev server start. Add/rename/delete route files only.

## Database Schema (Postgres)

Mirrors the capacitor app's SQLite schema. One account → many devices, each device has its own copy of the data. Sync merges by `updated_at` (last-write-wins).

```
users              — Better Auth managed
accounts           — Better Auth managed
sessions           — Better Auth managed

sync_books         — mirrors capacitor `books` (user_id, book_id, title, author, file_size, word_count, position, content, cover_image, chapters, updated_at)
sync_settings      — mirrors capacitor `settings` (user_id)
sync_highlights    — mirrors capacitor `highlights` (user_id, highlight_id)
```

Books store full plain text content, base64 cover image, and chapters JSON server-side for cross-device restore. Content is immutable per bookId — only pushed once.

## Auth (`src/lib/auth.ts`)

Better Auth wired at `src/routes/api/auth/$.ts` (catch-all handler). Client-side hooks in `src/lib/auth-client.ts`. Environment variables needed: `DATABASE_URL`, `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `BETTER_AUTH_URL`.

Trusted origins and CORS allowed origins share a single list in `src/lib/allowed-origins.ts`. Dev origins (`http://localhost`, `http://localhost:3001`) are only included when `NODE_ENV !== "production"`.

## Sync Architecture

Simple full-snapshot sync first. Delta sync can come later.

**Flow:**
1. User logs in → session token stored in Capacitor `@capacitor/preferences`
2. On app open: `GET /api/sync` → merge into local DB (server wins if `updated_at` newer)
3. On any local write: debounced `POST /api/sync` with updated rows

**Conflict resolution:** last-write-wins by `updated_at` for all entities. Highlights need a tombstone/soft-delete flag for deletions.

## Web App Embed

The capacitor app is built as a static SPA and served under `/app/*`. This gives the website the full app experience (library, reader, RSVP, highlights) without duplicating UI code.

**Build:** `pnpm build:app` (runs `scripts/build-capacitor-embed.sh`) — builds capacitor with `WEB_BUILD=1 VITE_SYNC_URL="" VITE_WEB_BUILD=true`, copies output to `public/app/`.

**SPA fallback:** `src/routes/app/$.ts` and `src/routes/app/index.ts` serve the capacitor `index.html` for all `/app/*` paths. Static assets (JS, CSS, WASM) in `public/app/assets/` are served directly by Nitro.

**Auth:** Same-domain cookie auth — user logs in on `/login`, the capacitor app detects the session via `/api/auth/get-session` and syncs automatically. No second login needed.

**Web adaptations in capacitor app:**
- `VITE_WEB_BUILD` env var enables: router basename `/app`, cookie auth (no Bearer token), WASM path `/app/assets`
- BLE/device UI hidden via `Capacitor.getPlatform() === "web"` checks
- File import uses HTML5 `<input type="file">` instead of native FilePicker
- `public/app/` is gitignored (build artifact)

## Open Todo

### Phase 3 — Sync ✅
- [x] `GET /api/sync` + `POST /api/sync` endpoints
- [x] Capacitor app sync service + `@capacitor/preferences` for session token
- [x] Login/account screen in capacitor app (optional, dismissible)
- [x] Sync indicator in capacitor UI (last synced timestamp)
- [x] Web app embed — capacitor SPA at `/app/*` with cookie auth

### Phase 4 — Polish
- [ ] `/account` page (connected devices, sync status, danger zone)
- [ ] Full docs (wiring diagrams, screenshots)
- [ ] Replace Ko-fi placeholder in `/device` with real URL
- [ ] Replace disabled Play Store badge in `/download` with real URL once published
- [ ] Open Graph images, SEO pass
- [ ] Transactional email provider for Better Auth verification emails (Resend / Postmark)
- [ ] MDX migration for `/docs` if content grows significantly
- [ ] Desktop UI polish for `/app` (wider layouts, sidebar nav, keyboard shortcuts)

## Open Questions

- **Donation platform**: Ko-fi vs GitHub Sponsors vs custom — placeholder in `/device` ready
- **Play Store**: needs publish decision before `/app` badge goes live
- **Domain**: not yet set — affects `BETTER_AUTH_URL` and CORS config
